Olympus is a set of frameworks aiding development Android apps based on geolocalized search.
<br/><br/>  
Five framework partecipate to this "ecosystem":  

 * *Diane*: provides awareness behaviours to app code (location/network/cache awareness)
  
  [https://github.com/k0smik0/diane](https://github.com/k0smik0/diane)  
 * *Socrates*: handles response to GooglePlaces rest query, binding from JSON to JAVA

 * *Ulysses*: combining Diane with Socrates, it provides a location/network-aware Google Place search framework
